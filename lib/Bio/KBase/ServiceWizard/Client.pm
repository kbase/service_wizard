module_name - the name of the service module, case-insensitive
version     - specify the service version, which can be either:
                (1) full git commit hash of the module version
                (2) semantic version or semantic version specification
                    Note: semantic version lookup will only work for 
                    released versions of the module.
                (3) release tag, which is one of: dev | beta | release

This information is always fetched from the Catalog, so for more details
on specifying the version, see the Catalog documentation for the
get_module_version method.
